# Kata: Hot Diggety Dog!

Local hot dog stand merchant wants a point-of-sale system for his hot dog stand operators

Requirements: must be lightweight in size--laptop is too unwieldy to use efficiently when making hot dogs on the street;
allow for discounts; track sales by time and location; send inventory updates to mobile inventory-management staff
(who drive to the location with supplies); provide a social-media integration so customers can be notified when a hot
dog stand is nearby

Users: fifty or so hot dog stand operators, thousands of customers in the local area (via social-media)
